EnderUNIX Aget 0.57 INSTALL
--------------------------

The program is tested on RedHat Linux 7.2 (gcc-2.96), FreeBSD 4.5
and Solaris 8. For Solaris, you'll have to use Makefile.Solaris.

To compile Aget, type:

# make  && make strip

To install the compiled binary, type:

# make install 

and binary will be installed as /usr/local/bin/aget

You're done. All you need is a file to download and supply
that url and desired number of segments to aget, e.g:

$ aget -n10 http://www.enderunix.org/murat/barismanco-hibrahimsofrasi.mp3 

Aget will split the file into 10 segments and will download it for you.


PS:
If your OS is MacOS X then, you can use the makefile Makefile.MacOSX
If Solaris, you can use Makefile.Solaris, and if it's FreeBSD, you can 
use the default one or Makefile.FreeBSD. Simply copy  the one 
which suits your platform over Makefile...
